# mmm-SharedKitchen

This is a module for MagicMirrorÂ² open-source software (https://magicmirror.builders/) and works in combination with my Shared Kitchen website, see https://github.com/Bram-van-Trigt/SharedKitchenWebsite. The magic mirror normally shows date, time and weather but now can show your recipes for the week. Additionally, you can show the full recipe while you are preparing your meal. 

_Note: both module and website are still works in early progress. Implemented in the module at this moment is, a widget to show your recipes for the week._
